        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Atomic Wiki organizes content into <b>sections</b> and <b>articles</b>. A section may contain several articles. One article may be defined as the entry page for the section.</p>
        <p>The URL uniquely identifies a section or an article. A section URL ends with a /. For example, the URL <i>http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/wiki/test/</i> will display the entry page of section "test" or - if no entry page is defined - all articles within the section.</p>
        <p>To access an article within a section, append the short ID of the article to the section URL. For example: <i>http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/wiki/test/MyTest</i>. A article URL will <b>never</b> end with a /.</p>
        <h2>Creating a New Section</h2>
        <p>To create a new section, log in and enter a section URL into your browsers location bar. If the section does not yet exists (and you&#160; are logged in), you will be presented with a form, asking for a title for the section.</p>
        <p class="wysiwyg-img-float-left">
            <img src="/data/screenshot1.png" width="320" alt="/exist/apps/wiki/data/screenshot1.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>Enter a title and click the store button. The section will be created and the browser will show a new, empty page. To create your first article, select <i>New HTML Article</i> from the <i>Section</i> dropdown menu:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/data/screenshot2.png" alt="/exist/apps/wiki/data/screenshot2.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>This will open the editor. You must now provide a title and a short name. The short name is used to uniquely identify the article. This is the name which will appear in URLs.</p>
        <p>If you want to use the article as the entry page for the section, select the <i>Index Page</i> checkbox. The setting for <i>Store</i> should be left as it is (checked).</p>
